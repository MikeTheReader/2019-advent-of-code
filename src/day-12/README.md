# Day 12 - The N-Body Problem

Like the 3 body problem but with more bodies.

Okay, so I'm just going to start writing out my thoughts and not divide them into unit tests / implementation. That was proving kind of "heavy".

# First Half

This one seems like a relatively simple object compare and change problem. Nice thing is there's plenty of data for unit tests.

I think I'll start with an `applyGravity` type method that will adjust two velocities.
