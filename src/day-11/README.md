# Day 11 - Space Police

Uh-oh -- it's the fuzz.

This one I worked through without stopping to think of how I was doing it. Turned out pretty quick, once I realized how the input/output flow worked (and held up my fingers to see see which way left was).

Overall, pretty happy with how the old IntCode from day 9 is working. :)
