# Day 15 - Oxygen System

Houston, we have a problem.

Can't say I've ever code any maze-solving algorithms, so this will be new territory.

Interesting part to this one, too, is that there really isn't any test cases to work from. Can't say I want to go through the effort of creating an intcode program that would give me desired results.

Should be fun.
